# Emotion-Recognition

To Detect Faces in order to perform Expression Recognition, Face Detection was performed using Haar-feature based Cascade Classifier. It is an effective object detection method proposed by Paul Viola and Michael Jones in their paper, “Rapid Object Detection using a Boosted Cascade of Simple Features” in 2001.
It is a machine learning based approach where a cascade function is trained from a lot of positive and negative images. It is then used to detect objects in other images.

For this project, pre-trained classifier was taken from : https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/master/data/haarcascades/haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml

The dataset for training CNN model for Facial Expression Recognition was downloaded from: https://www.kaggle.com/deadskull7/fer2013
